# ** Configuration Management Using Ansible and Terraform **

- One of the advantages of using Terraform & Ansible is that they can invoke each other, so we can fully automate the process at hand and have one command that we can run in order to both provision and configure our server
- The goal of the indipendent project is to set up and Ansible Playbook and Terraform file that provisions  resources on GCP and invokes the playbook to start the application.
- The environment is set up on Ubuntu as the base image
- The project implements variables and hosts
- The project runs in a GCP service (You will need an account with GCP)
